        Zach Barner is an artist who works in moving images using hybrid
        narrative methods. His recent work looks at play and silence as an act
        of resistance and a means against production, featuring the wind, chance
        encounters of the everyday, and finding joy. His work has premiered at
        the Gene Siskel Film Center, and projects he has collaborated on have
        been shown at Berlinale, Cannes, FID Marseille, Sundance, SXSW, TIFF,
        True/False, and Visions du Reel. He is the co-founder of the production
        company Thrd Factory. He has also worked with commercials, television,
        and film for networks such as HBO, FX, NBC, 20th Century Fox, Showtime,
        CW, and E! He studied his Bachelor of Fine Arts at The School of the Art
        Institute of Chicago. Residences include The Ragdale Foundation and
        Ox-bow School of the Art.
