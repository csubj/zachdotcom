          Once upon a time there was a little filmmaker... little but menacing,
          barely a filmmaker and already menacing, little and already menacing,
          little and already a filmmaker -â€”
        </p>
        <p>
          He is still only a filmmaker -- who is menacing -- but still enough of
          a filmmaker so that one has felt, that one feels, that one made him
          feel, that he is made to feel that he is, that he was a menace... with
          his cinematograph by his cinematograph; that he is menacing his
          cinematograph, that he was menacing, that he is a menace to the cinema
          with his cinematograph, by the cinematograph--that the cinematograph
          is a menace to the cinema.

        <p>
          Filmmaker so that we know his cinematograph is a menace to the cinema;
          may his cinematograph be menacing, be a menace.
