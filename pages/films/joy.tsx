                  Laith, whose family owns a Middle Eastern restaurant, returns
                  to Chicago from New York City, where he lives as a struggling
                  actor. Invited to a deep listening sonic meditation, he
                  travels to the Indiana Dunes, hoping to escape the dull
                  malaise of returning home. However, Laith abandons his plans
                  at the Dunes when he meets Arturo, a Paraguayan photographer
                  visiting Chicago, before attending a film workshop. Not
                  wanting to say goodbye, they explore the area together,
                  breaking into an empty house where their desire to play takes
                  over. Empowered by each other's willingness to rebel against
                  norms, they connect through the simulation of banal rituals of
                  the everyday.

                  Told through their two perspectives, the film responds to the
                  actualities of their individual lives. The film is not
                  scripted and is based on a real-life couple, capturing aspects
                  of their relationship and re-enacting their lives as they
                  navigate different proposals of play, sometimes political,
                  sexual, and quotidian.

                  A document of the infrathin, as described by Marcel Duchamp,
                  can only be defined through examples, exploring where the
                  leftover spaces and distance between these ephemeral
                  impressions existâ€”collapsing negative and positive spaces,
                  imprints and memories of ghosts, of bodies of spaces, what
                  separates these simultaneous in/out sensations? How do you
                  show the warmth of someone leaving? The first two chapters
                  follow a structure that implies multiple perspectives and
                  repetition as an exploration of liminality. This form echoes
                  fugues and the paintings of Cezanne as a way to see
                  multifarious perspectives and observations on the sacred and
                  banal.

                  The repetition in a film about joy brings attention to the
                  minor differences of subjective experience while celebrating a
                  sense of sacredness in the everyday. Silence and the wind
                  become stars as they pursue a new way of living founded in
                  play. Regaining this capacity to play and noticing the
                  disappearance of rituals is not nostalgia but rather a way to
                  remember the excitement of when trees were seen moving. How do
                  we allow trees to be trees again?
